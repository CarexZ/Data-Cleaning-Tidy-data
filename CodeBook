This is a CODEBOOK for a tidy set ("tidyset.txt")
Tidyset.txt contains data on 81 variables for 181 observations.

In the experiments 30 volunteers aged from 19 to 48 years performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist and a number of different accelerometer data were collected. From this Raw dataset we extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. This resulted in a Full dataset with 10 299 observations. From these data we then created an independent dataset - Tidy dataset.

In the Tidy dataset we selected variables from the initial dataset, containing  values for the variables and calculated average for each individual for each activity. 

The final tidy dataset description is below, in the following order: 

Column number - Column name - Column variables description - Possible values.

V# - NAME       - Description 
1 - SUBJECT     - Individuals performed exersises - 1 to 30.

2 - ACTIVITY    - The activitiy perfomrd
                    WALKING
                    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
                    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
                    SITTING
                    STANDING
                    LAYING

3-81 - MEASURED VARIABLES, AVERAGE, they contain
    mean() - for mean values, 
    std() - for standard deviation, 
    XYZ - for each of 3  axis, if applicable for variable.
