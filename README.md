Files in this repository are:
Readme.md - brief description  
run_analysis.R - script with comments  
CodeBook.md - script with more detailed comments  
fullset2.txt - intermediate "full" dataset from step 4 (see below)  

tidyset.txt - final tidy dataset  

run-analysis.R script does this:  
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
This tidyset.txt is also uploaded on coursera server.
